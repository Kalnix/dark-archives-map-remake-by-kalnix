# dark-archives-map-remake-by-kalnix
**Version 1.2** Completely remade the Beast of Birchfrost maps and added shadows to most others to make them not look as flat.

**FoundryVTT module for Dark Archive Map Remakes**

This is a map remake of the adventures from the Dark Archive souce book created by Paizo. You can buy the book here https://paizo.com/products/btq02arq?Pathfinder-Dark-Archive as well as find the adventue In Darkness which was released as the reward for an ARG. It does not have any of the content besides remade maps, you will need to own the book to be able to run the adventures.

These maps are designed for FoundryVTT with walls, windows, doors and lighting set up.
If you would just like the maps, download them from the map folder. Each square is 128x128px

Adventure 8: The Last Dream has a section where you need to rotate parts of the map. There are macros set up to do so and also open/close the correct secret doors so that the walls "move" with the map. The only swap between on/off so if you accidentally click one make sure to click it again.

Massive thanks to DrentalBot, Mark Pearce, Zhell, Cora, Graff, Flix from the FoundryVTT discord and Pathfinder 2e For Foundry discords for their help with getting the macros for the Scattered Storybook working. I think it makes that adventure vastly better.
